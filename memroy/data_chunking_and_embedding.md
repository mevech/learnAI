# Data Chunking and Embedding

Before information is even stored, it must be broken down into manageable pieces and converted into numerical representations (embeddings). The strategy for doing this significantly impacts retrieval quality. The way you chunk your data directly impacts the relevance of the information your LLM can retrieve.

## Chunking Strategies

### Fixed-Size Chunking
The simplest method is to divide the text into chunks of a specific number of tokens (e.g., 200 words) with some overlap to maintain context between chunks. This is easy to implement but can awkwardly split related ideas.

### Content-Aware Chunking
More advanced methods break up text based on semantic meaning or the structure of the content itself. This can be done by splitting on paragraphs, sentences, or using natural language processing libraries to identify logical breaks in the text. For code, it might be chunking by functions or classes. This ensures that the embedded vectors represent coherent thoughts.

### Recursive Chunking
This technique involves recursively breaking down larger chunks into smaller ones until a desired size is reached, often using a hierarchy of separators (e.g., paragraphs, then sentences). This hierarchical structure can be useful for retrieving context at different levels of granularity.

## Metadata Attachment
Crucially, each chunk should be stored with relevant metadata. This can include the source document, creation date, author, or any other structured information that can be used to filter search results later.
